              To form and develop a project, the contribution of the chairman is
              extremely important. Today, let's follow us to learn about the
              leader of Eco Smart Vietnam - Mr. Bui Dinh Tri through the small
              interview below as well as understand more interesting information
              about Eco Smart home. Let's get started.
            </p>
            <p class="question">
              Question 1: Introduce yourself and tell 3 interesting things about
              yourself.
            </p>
            <p class = "answer">
              Mr. Tri: I am currently an overseas student studying 2 majors:
              Computer Science and Economics in the US. Three interesting things
              about me are probably that I am left-handed, high-dose (but
              reckless and in control) and lazy to study (but still learn well).
            </p>
            <p class="question">
              Question 2: Mr Tri, what was the fate that motivated you to found
              Eco Smart Vietnam?
            </p>
            <p class ="answer">
              Mr. Tri: The charm probably stems from my participation in one of
              the annual activities of my school's Young Entrepreneurs and
              Entrepreneurship Support Center, it is the Macalester
              Entrepreneurship and Innovation Department that rewards young
              people with ideas, special initiatives that help improve the lives
              of the communities around them. I was lucky to win the award and
              Eco Smart Vietnam was the idea that helped me win that award (the
              original name was Eco Heroes Campaign).
            </p>
            <p class="question">
              Question 3: Could you share a little about the goals and
              expectations that you set at Eco Smart Vietnam in the future?
            </p>
            <p class = "answer">
              Mr. Tri: As I share, I am a high-dose blood person but in control,
              so I set goals/expectations that often balance between far-fetched
              and realistic. I really expect Eco Smart Vietnam to become one of
              the largest and most professional environmental organizations in
              the North. However, in my mind, I think that in the short term, it
              only needs to be the largest in Hanoi (probably the largest HN is
              likely to be top 2, top 3 in the North, right?
            </p>
            <p class="question">
              Question 4: Do you have anything to say to readers and followers
              of the project?
            </p>
            <p class ="answer">
              Mr. Tri: My message is: "Eco Smart Vietnam will be a project that
              will not let followers and expectations down because with the Eco
              Smart team - the team I believe is full of talented and
              responsible people - will be able to help the project grow and
              spread far and wide. In addition, a small promise is that Eco
              Smart Vietnam will always try its best to fulfill the mission that
              we set out: Acting for the development and safety of the
              environment in Vietnam!‚Äù
